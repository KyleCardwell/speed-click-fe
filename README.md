# level ideas
- tap green squares to make them blue.  level done when all squares are blue. tapping a blue square will end the game
- levels of different size boards
- continuous, board resets each time its cleared, play for time or high score
- some squares need to be double-tapped, some single-tapped
- some squares have symbols (all green) and only certain symbols can be tapped
- all symbols of one design have to be tapped before other symbols can be tapped
- "memory" game - show player all green squares, then turn all squares red.  only tap where there were green squares
- shifty - remaining squares move around after each click
